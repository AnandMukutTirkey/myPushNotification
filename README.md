# myPushNotification
this is a project i worked after my exams to become familier with networking stuffs in ios
I decided to find a way through which i can communicate with my users without help of apple (APN)
so this app uses background fetch to see if there are any updates available? if yes then it creates a local notification with badges
when user enters the app badge disappears and updated content is presented
works good but may have some bugs
